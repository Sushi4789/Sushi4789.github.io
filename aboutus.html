                            <p class = "text text-lg">Welcome to SSC Hospital</p><br>
                            <p class = "text texts">The SSC Society's successful foray into healthcare began with the SSC Super specialty Hospital and Research Centre - a Hospital offering 2000 beds and state of the art medical facilities. The CSS Society continues the fine tradition of service through the SSC Hospital & Medical Research Centre, Bengaluru. This 2000 beds modern hospital envisioned by Dr. Suchet Rao Giri set on an 17 acre sprawling land mass also offers concessional beds to the poor and needy populace. The hospital provides the services of more than 300 consultant doctors, skilled nurses, technical and paramedical staff. The state of the art infrastructure includes 30 operation theatres and a wide range of specialty & super specialty features 
                                                                The leadership lineage dates back to 1995 wherein Colonel A K Singh, the harbinger took over the mantle of Medical Director on 02 May 95. This day on, the institution has heralded on its path of progress. On 06 Jan 2003, Dr MV Jali took over the reins of the hospital and successfully steered the development & research programs for more than two decades. The present incumbent Dr (Col) M Dayananada, a Military veteran assumed the appointment as Medical Director on 02 Nov 22 and with his stellar leadership has scaled this very Hospital & MRC on the National horizon. 
                                                                The SSC Hospital & MRC has achieved many distinctions in Cardiac and multi organ transplants. The US based “Smile Train Project” enables children with cleft - lip & palate and other dental deformities to benefit from surgery. The track record of the hospital is indicative of myriad appreciations & accolades with “A” Grade accreditation by NAAC.    
                                                      Recognizing the impetus of research in healthcare studies, the hospital provides clinical facilities to the students of the attached Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College under the aegis of SSC Academy of Higher Education & Research(KAHER) situated in the campus, which offers under graduate, post graduate and post-doctoral super specialty courses. The hospital has subsidiary health care centres at Kalaburagi,Mysuru, Belagavi and Ramnagar . In its endeavor to deliver quality healthcare to all sections of society , the hospital continues to set excellent standards and ensures that the SSC Hospital& MRC remains a role model that symbolizes the highest levels of healthcare at par with the best in the country.
